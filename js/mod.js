		- 19 more upgrades were added in (E P I C)<br>
		- Even more of electric boogaloo with unexpected ending and gimmicks<br>
		- You still can't get 5th Square Expansion and I swear to god if you tell me that it's supposed to drop down 1 Shenanigans more, then guess what? 5th Square Expansion doesn't exist.<br><br>

		- 9 more Shenanigans upgrades, 1 more Square Expansions milestone and 8 more achievements<br>
		- Shitton of references were poured in<br>
		- Unnecessary amount of texts were added in<br>
		- Fixed the bug, where challenge's effect still persist after Square Expansion reset<br>
		- just play this mod already already omg.<br><br>
		v0.1.1: Balance Update<br>
		- Changed 14th upgrade's effects to make it feel like it actually does something<br>
		- Due it working more effecient, the costs of later upgrades were raised to match the changes <br><br>
	<h3>v0.1: Grand opening... Or is it grand publishing?</h3><br>
		- Added this, that, did some stuff there- you get the point.<br>
		- But seriously, there's 3 "layers" in total, craptons of upgrades and challenges for v0.1.<br>
		- idk what else to say about the mod, that was just released.`
