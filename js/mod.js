let changelog = `<h1>Changelog:</h1><br>
	<h3>v1.0.1: Alright, here's my idea...</h3><br>
		- Made it so it was NOT impossible to reach the "Finale" part (via making 26th Shenanigans upgrade cost 1000 Shenanigans or more, depending on how much you have)<br>
		- Fixed Changelog itself<br>
		- Changed several things as well (including The Endgamer's Revengeance)<br><br>
	<h2>v1.0: IT'S TIME TO STOP!</h2><br>
		This is the last major update ST:R will receive due the fact there's little I can do without either reworking, rebalancing or even reinventing stuff, so... Yeah, this is as far as ST:R can go without looking like a boring mess ST is<br>
		- "Infinitish Boost" displays the effets correctly<br>
		- You CAN get 5th Sqaure Expansion now... But at what cost<br>
		- Six more achievements<br>
		- Five more Shenanigans upgrades<br>
		- One more Impatience buyable<br>
		- Ye olde goodie Shenanigans challenge from ST has been added in<br>
		v0.3.1.1: it doesn't even deserve a title<br>
		- Last Transcendence upgrade's cost has been decreased down to e3500, but it'll increase the more enlightment points you have<br><br>
		v0.3.1: god OOFing damn it let me take a break for 5 hours<br>
		- Fixed some grammatical errors
		- Increased most Shenanigans upgrades's cost<br>
		- Increased Chaos and Transcendence layers's base<br>
		- Nerfed "Shenanigans Upgrade", "A Little Exponent Won't Hurt... I swear to the Jevil himself, it won't inflate like \"NerfBusters\" before the rework!" and NerfBusters (rip Nerf Meta)<br>
		- Increased "Adventure Jevilist"'s requirement<br>
		- Lowered 30th achievement's requirement<br>
		- Removed Transcended Exponent's hardcap and made 30th achievement "better"<br>
		- Also increased some of Chaos's and Transcendence's upgrades's cost<br>
		- Now you can buy NerfBusters before buying first Impatience-inator, so long as you have 2 Impatiences to spend<br><br>
	<h3>v0.3: The moment you all have been waiting for</h3><br>
		[1/2]<br>
		- Updated TMT from 2.Ï€ to 2.5.2.1
		- NerfBusters is now only purchasable with at least one Impatience-inator<br>
		- Chaos and Transcendence layers are now functionable<br>
		- Gave the name of each version and fixed the spacing in changelog<br>
		- Achievements now has images (Wow. Much quality. Such fun.) [NOT IMPLEMENTED]<br><br>
		What comes with those new layers:<br>
		- A total of 12 upgrades (18 more upgrades will be added later)<br>
		- Five more achievements (6 more achievements will be added layer)<br>
		- Even more shitposts, memes and (JOJO) references<br>
		- Still no 5th Square Expansion<br><br>
		[2/2]<br>
		- 6 more achivements were added in, as promised<br>
		- Transcended is now connected to Impatience and both 2nd row layers are connected to each other<br>
		- 19 more upgrades were added in (E P I C)<br>
		- Even more of electric boogaloo with unexpected ending and gimmicks<br>
		- You still can't get 5th Square Expansion and I swear to god if you tell me that it's supposed to drop down 1 Shenanigans more, then guess what? 5th Square Expansion doesn't exist.<br><br>
		It does not exist.<br><br>
		It does not exist.<br><br>
		It does not exist.<br><br><br>
		v0.2.1: haha shitpost go brrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr<br>
		- Rebalanced early-late game (Reworked 2nd Impatience buyable)<br>
		- ???<br><br>
	<h3>v0.2: Rebalance Update</h3><br>
		- Reworked/Added Impatience Layer (2 buyables, 5 upgrades)<br>
		- Changed "Ah yes, the Nothinginator"'s formula<br>
		- Due the previous change in this changelog, some of upgrades's cost were balanced<br>
		- Achievement layer now becomes green when you get all achievements<br>
		- Changed descriptions there and there, you know the stuff.<br>
		- 9 more Shenanigans upgrades, 1 more Square Expansions milestone and 8 more achievements<br>
		- Shitton of references were poured in<br>
		- Unnecessary amount of texts were added in<br>
		- Fixed the bug, where challenge's effect still persist after Square Expansion reset<br>
		- just play this mod already already omg.<br><br>
		v0.1.1: Balance Update<br>
		- Changed 14th upgrade's effects to make it feel like it actually does something<br>
		- Due it working more effecient, the costs of later upgrades were raised to match the changes <br><br>
	<h3>v0.1: Grand opening... Or is it grand publishing?</h3><br>
		- Added this, that, did some stuff there- you get the point.<br>
		- But seriously, there's 3 "layers" in total, craptons of upgrades and challenges for v0.1.<br>
		- idk what else to say about the mod, that was just released.`
